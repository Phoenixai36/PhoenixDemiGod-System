# Agent Hooks Enhancement System

A sophisticated event-driven automation framework that integrates with Kiro's IDE environment to provide intelligent, context-aware automation.

## Overview

The Agent Hooks Enhancement system is designed to create intelligent automation triggers that monitor system performance, code quality, and development workflows. These hooks automatically execute agent tasks when specific conditions are met, leading to improved development velocity, code quality, and system reliability.

## Key Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Reacts to file system events, system performance metrics, and development lifecycle events
- **Intelligent Automation**: Context-aware hooks that adapt to the current development environment
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new hooks and event sources
- **Resource Management**: Efficient resource utilization with limits and prioritization
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration system for hooks and system settings

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure hooks in `config/hooks/`:
   ```yaml
   name: "CodeQualityHook"
   description: "Automatically checks code quality on file save"
   enabled: true
   priority: "HIGH"
   triggers:
     - "file_save"
   file_patterns:
     - "*.py"
     - "*.js"
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Custom Hook

```python
from src.agent_hooks.core.models import AgentHook, HookContext, HookResult

class MyCustomHook(AgentHook):
    async def should_execute(self, context: HookContext) -> bool:
        # Determine if this hook should execute
        return True
    
    async def execute(self, context: HookContext) -> HookResult:
        # Execute the hook
        return HookResult.success_result("Hook executed successfully")
    
    def get_resource_requirements(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Specify resource requirements
        return {"cpu": 0.1, "memory_mb": 50}
```

### Triggering a Hook Manually

```python
from src.agent_hooks.core.models import HookContext
from src.agent_hooks.hooks.example_hook import ExampleHook

# Create a hook
hook = ExampleHook({
    "name": "MyHook",
    "description": "My custom hook",
    "message": "Hello, world!"
})

# Create a context
context = HookContext(
    trigger_event={"type": "manual"},
    project_state={},
    system_metrics={},
    user_preferences={}
)

# Execute the hook
result = await hook.execute(context)
print(result.message)  # "Hello, world!"
```
