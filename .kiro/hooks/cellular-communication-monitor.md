# Cellular Communication Protocol Monitor

## Overview

This hook monitors the Cellular Communication Protocol (CCP) in the PHOENIXxHYDRA system, providing real-time insights into message flows, network topology, and communication performance. It helps identify bottlenecks, security issues, and optimization opportunities in the cellular mesh network.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of message flows between cells
- Visualization of network topology and communication patterns
- Detection of communication bottlenecks and performance issues
- Security monitoring and breach detection
- Tesla resonance parameter optimization
- Communication pattern analysis and recommendations

## Activation Events

This hook is triggered by the following events:

- **On File Save**: When CCP-related files are modified
- **On Interval**: Every 5 minutes to collect and analyze communication metrics
- **On Manual Trigger**: When explicitly invoked through the Kiro UI

## Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "cellular-communication-monitor",
  "description": "Monitors and analyzes the Cellular Communication Protocol",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "author": "PHOENIXxHYDRA Team",
  "triggers": [
    {
      "type": "file_save",
      "pattern": "src/phoenixxhydra/networking/ccp/**/*.py"
    },
    {
      "type": "interval",
      "minutes": 5
    },
    {
      "type": "manual",
      "label": "Analyze CCP Communication"
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "run_hook",
      "hook": "cellular-communication-hook",
      "method": "analyze_communication_patterns"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

To manually trigger the CCP analysis:

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Type "Kiro: Run Hook"
3. Select "Analyze CCP Communication"

The hook will analyze the current communication patterns in the PHOENIXxHYDRA system and provide recommendations for optimization.

## Integration

This hook integrates with:

- **PHOENIXxHYDRA Cellular Architecture**: Monitors cell communication
- **Tesla Resonance System**: Optimizes frequency synchronization
- **Quantum-Resistant Security**: Detects potential security breaches
- **Adaptive Routing**: Analyzes network topology and routing efficiency

## Metrics

The hook collects and displays the following metrics:

- Message throughput and latency
- Encryption level distribution
- Communication pattern efficiency
- Tesla resonance quality
- Security alert frequency and severity
- Network topology changes
