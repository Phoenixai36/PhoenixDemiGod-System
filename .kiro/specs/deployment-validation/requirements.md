# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Phoenix Hydra Deployment Validation feature provides a comprehensive automated system to deploy, validate, and prove the functionality of the entire Phoenix Hydra stack. This feature ensures that all components work together seamlessly and provides confidence in the system's operational readiness through systematic testing and validation of all services, workflows, and integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy all Phoenix Hydra services with a single command, so that I can quickly set up the entire system without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment command is executed THEN the system SHALL start all required containers using Podman Compose
2. WHEN containers are starting THEN the system SHALL monitor startup progress and report status for each service
3. WHEN a service fails to start THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before marking it as failed
4. WHEN all services are deployed THEN the system SHALL wait for all health checks to pass before proceeding
5. IF any critical service fails to deploy THEN the system SHALL halt deployment and provide detailed error information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated health checks for all services, so that I can verify each component is functioning correctly after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL execute health checks for Phoenix Core on port 8080
2. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL verify NCA Toolkit accessibility on port 8081
3. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL confirm n8n workflow engine is responsive on port 5678
4. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL validate Windmill service availability on port 8000
5. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL test PostgreSQL database connectivity on port 5432
6. IF any health check fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 5 times with exponential backoff
7. WHEN all health checks pass THEN the system SHALL proceed to functional validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want functional testing of key workflows, so that I can ensure the system's core capabilities are working end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functional testing begins THEN the system SHALL execute a sample n8n workflow to verify automation capabilities
2. WHEN functional testing runs THEN the system SHALL test Windmill script execution and GitOps functionality
3. WHEN functional testing runs THEN the system SHALL validate revenue tracking script execution
4. WHEN functional testing runs THEN the system SHALL test affiliate badge deployment functionality
5. WHEN functional testing runs THEN the system SHALL verify NEOTEC grant application generation
6. IF any functional test fails THEN the system SHALL capture detailed logs and error information
7. WHEN all functional tests pass THEN the system SHALL generate a validation report

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want container orchestration validation, so that I can ensure the Podman-based infrastructure is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN container validation runs THEN the system SHALL verify all containers are in running state
2. WHEN container validation runs THEN the system SHALL check container resource usage is within acceptable limits
3. WHEN container validation runs THEN the system SHALL validate container networking and port accessibility
4. WHEN container validation runs THEN the system SHALL test container restart capabilities
5. WHEN container validation runs THEN the system SHALL verify container log accessibility
6. IF container validation detects issues THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic remediation
7. WHEN container validation completes THEN the system SHALL report container health status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want a comprehensive deployment report, so that I can have confidence in the system's operational status and share results with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed deployment report in JSON format
2. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include deployment timestamps and duration
3. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL document all service health check results
4. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include functional test outcomes and performance metrics
5. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL provide container status and resource utilization data
6. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include any errors or warnings encountered
7. WHEN the report is complete THEN the system SHALL save it to the monitoring directory with timestamp
8. WHEN the report is complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary to the console

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want automated cleanup and rollback capabilities, so that I can recover from failed deployments without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically stop all started containers
2. WHEN cleanup is triggered THEN the system SHALL remove any created networks and volumes
3. WHEN cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL preserve logs and error information for debugging
4. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL restore the previous working configuration
5. IF cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual cleanup instructions
6. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL report the final system state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want validation of security configurations, so that I can ensure the deployment follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security validation runs THEN the system SHALL verify containers are running with appropriate user permissions
2. WHEN security validation runs THEN the system SHALL check that no containers are running as root
3. WHEN security validation runs THEN the system SHALL validate network isolation between services
4. WHEN security validation runs THEN the system SHALL verify SSL/TLS configurations where applicable
5. WHEN security validation runs THEN the system SHALL check for exposed sensitive ports
6. IF security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them in the deployment report
7. WHEN security validation completes THEN the system SHALL provide security compliance status
