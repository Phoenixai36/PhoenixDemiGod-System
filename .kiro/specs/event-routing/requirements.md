# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Event Routing System is a critical component of the PHOENIXxHYDRA architecture that enables efficient communication between different parts of the system. It provides a mechanism for routing events from publishers to subscribers based on event types and patterns, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous communication models. The system includes features for event filtering, correlation, and replay to ensure reliable message delivery and system recovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Event Routing Core Functionality

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want to route events between different components of the system, so that components can communicate without direct coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is published THEN the system SHALL deliver it to all subscribed handlers
2. WHEN a component subscribes to an event type THEN the system SHALL register the subscription
3. WHEN a component unsubscribes from an event type THEN the system SHALL remove the subscription
4. WHEN an event is published THEN the system SHALL support both synchronous and asynchronous delivery modes
5. WHEN multiple handlers are subscribed to the same event THEN the system SHALL deliver the event to all handlers

### Requirement 2: Event Filtering and Pattern Matching

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want to filter events based on patterns and conditions, so that components only receive events they are interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component subscribes to events THEN the system SHALL allow subscription with pattern matching
2. WHEN an event is published THEN the system SHALL match it against registered patterns
3. WHEN an event matches a pattern THEN the system SHALL deliver it only to handlers with matching patterns
4. WHEN a pattern includes wildcards THEN the system SHALL support matching multiple event types
5. WHEN a pattern includes attribute filters THEN the system SHALL filter events based on their attributes

### Requirement 3: Event Correlation

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want to correlate related events, so that I can track and process event sequences and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are part of the same workflow THEN the system SHALL maintain correlation identifiers
2. WHEN a correlated event is received THEN the system SHALL associate it with previous events in the same correlation
3. WHEN a component requests correlated events THEN the system SHALL provide access to the complete correlation chain
4. WHEN a new correlation is started THEN the system SHALL generate a unique correlation identifier
5. WHEN events from different sources share a correlation ID THEN the system SHALL treat them as part of the same workflow

### Requirement 4: Event Replay and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to replay events for recovery or testing purposes, so that I can restore system state or validate system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system stores events THEN it SHALL maintain an event log for replay
2. WHEN a replay is requested THEN the system SHALL replay events in the original order
3. WHEN replaying events THEN the system SHALL mark them as replayed events
4. WHEN a component requests event history THEN the system SHALL provide filtered access to stored events
5. WHEN the event log reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL implement a retention policy

### Requirement 5: Integration with Agent Hooks

**User Story:** As an agent developer, I want to integrate the event routing system with agent hooks, so that agents can respond to system events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent hook is registered THEN the system SHALL subscribe it to relevant events
2. WHEN an event matches an agent hook's criteria THEN the system SHALL trigger the hook
3. WHEN an agent hook processes an event THEN the system SHALL handle success and failure appropriately
4. WHEN an agent hook publishes a response event THEN the system SHALL route it to interested subscribers
5. WHEN an agent hook is unregistered THEN the system SHALL remove all its event subscriptions
