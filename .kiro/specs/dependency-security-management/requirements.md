# Dependency Security Management Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic management of npm dependencies and security vulnerabilities in the Phoenix Hydra dashboard project. The current project faces recurring security vulnerabilities in packages like `react-syntax-highlighter`, `prismjs`, and related dependencies that need to be resolved while maintaining development velocity and code stability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Security Vulnerability Detection

**User Story:** As a Phoenix Hydra developer, I want automated detection of security vulnerabilities in dependencies, so that I can address security issues before they impact production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project dependencies are installed or updated THEN the system SHALL automatically scan for known security vulnerabilities
2. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report with severity levels and remediation steps
3. WHEN critical or high-severity vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL block the build process until resolved
4. IF moderate or low-severity vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings but allow builds to continue
5. WHEN vulnerability scans complete THEN the results SHALL be stored in a centralized security log for audit purposes

### Requirement 2: Automated Dependency Updates

**User Story:** As a Phoenix Hydra developer, I want automated dependency updates with compatibility testing, so that I can keep dependencies current without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency updates are available THEN the system SHALL automatically create update proposals with impact analysis
2. WHEN security patches are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize these updates over feature updates
3. WHEN major version updates are detected THEN the system SHALL require manual approval before applying changes
4. IF automated tests pass after dependency updates THEN the system SHALL automatically merge the changes
5. WHEN dependency updates fail tests THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and notify developers

### Requirement 3: Dependency Lock and Audit Trail

**User Story:** As a Phoenix Hydra developer, I want a complete audit trail of dependency changes, so that I can track security improvements and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are modified THEN the system SHALL record the change with timestamp, reason, and developer information
2. WHEN security vulnerabilities are resolved THEN the system SHALL document the resolution method and verification steps
3. WHEN dependency conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed resolution guidance with Phoenix Hydra-specific considerations
4. IF dependency changes affect Phoenix Hydra core functionality THEN the system SHALL trigger comprehensive integration tests
5. WHEN audit reports are generated THEN they SHALL include security posture improvements and remaining risks

### Requirement 4: Phoenix Hydra Specific Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a Phoenix Hydra developer, I want dependency management that respects Phoenix Hydra's offline-first and security-focused architecture, so that external dependencies don't compromise system integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new dependencies are proposed THEN the system SHALL verify they support offline operation
2. WHEN dependencies require external network access THEN the system SHALL flag them for security review
3. WHEN dependencies conflict with Phoenix Hydra's rootless container requirements THEN the system SHALL reject the installation
4. IF dependencies include telemetry or tracking THEN the system SHALL provide configuration to disable these features
5. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN they SHALL be scanned for compliance with Phoenix Hydra's privacy-first principles

### Requirement 5: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a Phoenix Hydra developer, I want dependency management integrated into my development workflow, so that security and updates don't interrupt my coding productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start development THEN the system SHALL automatically check for and resolve minor security updates
2. WHEN I commit code THEN the system SHALL verify no new vulnerabilities were introduced
3. WHEN I create pull requests THEN the system SHALL include dependency security status in the review process
4. IF security updates require code changes THEN the system SHALL provide automated migration suggestions
5. WHEN I deploy to staging THEN the system SHALL perform a final security verification before deployment

### Requirement 6: Emergency Security Response

**User Story:** As a Phoenix Hydra developer, I want rapid response capabilities for critical security vulnerabilities, so that I can protect production systems immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical vulnerabilities are announced THEN the system SHALL immediately assess impact on Phoenix Hydra components
2. WHEN emergency patches are available THEN the system SHALL provide fast-track update procedures
3. WHEN vulnerabilities affect production THEN the system SHALL provide rollback procedures and alternative solutions
4. IF patches are not available THEN the system SHALL suggest temporary mitigation strategies
5. WHEN emergency updates are applied THEN the system SHALL verify system stability and security posture

### Requirement 7: Reporting and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a Phoenix Hydra system administrator, I want comprehensive reporting on dependency security status, so that I can make informed decisions about system maintenance and updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security reports are generated THEN they SHALL include trend analysis and risk assessment
2. WHEN dependency updates are completed THEN the system SHALL provide before/after security comparisons
3. WHEN vulnerabilities remain unresolved THEN the system SHALL provide risk mitigation recommendations
4. IF security posture degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators with specific remediation steps
5. WHEN compliance audits are required THEN the system SHALL generate detailed security compliance reports
