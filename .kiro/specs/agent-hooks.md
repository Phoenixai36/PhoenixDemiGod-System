# Agent Hooks Steering Document

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic direction for the agent hooks system within the Phoenix Hydra project. The primary goal is to refactor the existing agent hooks into a more robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture. This initiative will improve the modularity of the system, enhance testability, and provide a clear framework for developing new hooks.

## Key Objectives

*   **Architectural Refactoring:** Migrate all existing agent hooks to a new, unified architecture. This includes the Cellular Communication Hook, Container Health Restart Hook, Container Log Analysis Hook, and Container Resource Scaling Hook.
*   **Improved Modularity:** Decouple individual hooks from the core system to allow for independent development, testing, and deployment.
*   **Enhanced Testability:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for each hook, ensuring reliability and stability.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Introduce a centralized hook registry and configuration system to allow for dynamic enabling, disabling, and configuration of hooks without requiring a full system restart.
*   **Clear Development Patterns:** Provide clear documentation, examples, and development patterns to streamline the creation of new agent hooks.

## Core Components

*   **AgentHook Base Class:** A common base class for all agent hooks, providing a consistent interface and core functionality.
*   **EventRouter Integration:** A robust integration with the event routing system to allow hooks to subscribe to specific events and trigger actions.
*   **HookRegistry:** A centralized registry for managing the lifecycle of all agent hooks.
*   **Configuration System:** A flexible configuration system for managing hook-specific settings and parameters.
