# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a comprehensive automation system for managing Phoenix Hydra services using Podman Compose. The system will provide reliable container orchestration, health monitoring, and automated deployment capabilities for the Phoenix Hydra stack, ensuring seamless service management across development and production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start all Phoenix Hydra services with a single command, so that I can quickly set up my development environment without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the podman compose command THEN the system SHALL start all required Phoenix Hydra services in the correct order
2. WHEN services are starting THEN the system SHALL display real-time status updates for each container
3. WHEN all services are running THEN the system SHALL verify health checks for each service
4. IF any service fails to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated health monitoring for all containerized services, so that I can ensure system reliability and quick issue detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor container health status
2. WHEN a container becomes unhealthy THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt restart procedures
3. WHEN restart attempts fail THEN the system SHALL send notifications and log detailed error information
4. WHEN services recover THEN the system SHALL log recovery events and update monitoring dashboards

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want environment-specific configuration management, so that I can deploy the same stack across different environments with appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL load environment-specific configuration files
2. WHEN configuration changes are detected THEN the system SHALL validate configuration syntax and compatibility
3. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and display validation errors
4. WHEN valid configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL update running services with zero-downtime deployment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integrated logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL aggregate logs from all containers in a centralized location
2. WHEN performance metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and recommendations
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide easy access to container logs and system metrics
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation and cleanup policies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team member, I want VS Code integration for container management, so that I can manage services directly from my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working in VS Code THEN the system SHALL provide tasks for common container operations
2. WHEN services need to be restarted THEN the system SHALL allow one-click restart from VS Code
3. WHEN viewing service status THEN the system SHALL display real-time container information in VS Code
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide direct access to container logs from VS Code

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want rootless container execution, so that I can run services without elevated privileges while maintaining security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are started THEN the system SHALL run all containers in rootless mode using Podman
2. WHEN accessing host resources THEN the system SHALL use proper user namespace mapping
3. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL integrate with secure credential management systems
4. IF privilege escalation is attempted THEN the system SHALL block the operation and log security events
