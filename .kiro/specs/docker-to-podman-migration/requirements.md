# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on migrating the existing Docker-based container infrastructure to Podman for the Phoenix Hydra system. The migration will convert all Docker Compose configurations and Dockerfiles to be fully compatible with Podman, ensuring rootless execution, improved security, and alignment with Phoenix Hydra's architectural principles while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Docker Compose to Podman Compose, so that I can run containers in rootless mode with improved security and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use podman-compose instead of docker-compose for all container operations
2. WHEN containers are started THEN the system SHALL run all containers in rootless mode without requiring sudo privileges
3. WHEN services are deployed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality as the original Docker setup
4. IF podman-compose is not available THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions and fallback options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all existing Dockerfiles converted to work optimally with Podman, so that I can leverage Podman's security and performance benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Dockerfiles are converted THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with Podman's rootless execution model
2. WHEN images are built THEN the system SHALL use Podman's buildah backend for improved build performance
3. WHEN containers run THEN the system SHALL properly handle user namespace mapping and file permissions
4. WHEN using multi-stage builds THEN the system SHALL optimize for Podman's caching mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the compose.yaml file updated for Podman compatibility, so that all services start correctly with proper networking and volume mounting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the compose file is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing service definitions and dependencies
2. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL use Podman's networking capabilities for inter-service communication
3. WHEN volumes are mounted THEN the system SHALL handle rootless volume mounting with proper permissions
4. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL properly resolve them in the Podman context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want updated deployment scripts that work with Podman, so that I can deploy and manage the Phoenix Hydra stack using Podman commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment scripts run THEN the system SHALL detect and use podman-compose instead of docker-compose
2. WHEN services are deployed THEN the system SHALL provide the same verification and health checking capabilities
3. WHEN teardown is performed THEN the system SHALL properly clean up Podman containers, networks, and volumes
4. WHEN scripts execute THEN the system SHALL provide clear status messages and error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper networking configuration for Podman, so that all services can communicate effectively while maintaining security isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers start THEN the system SHALL create proper Podman networks for service communication
2. WHEN services need to communicate THEN the system SHALL ensure DNS resolution works between containers
3. WHEN external access is needed THEN the system SHALL properly map ports for external connectivity
4. WHEN network isolation is required THEN the system SHALL implement proper network segmentation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the migration to maintain or improve security posture, so that the system runs with minimal privileges and maximum security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers run THEN the system SHALL execute all containers without root privileges
2. WHEN accessing host resources THEN the system SHALL use proper user namespace mapping
3. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL integrate with Podman's secrets management capabilities
4. WHEN containers are isolated THEN the system SHALL maintain proper security boundaries between services
