# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a high-performance, gamified 3D chatbot dashboard that serves as the primary interface between users and the Phoenix Hydra AI system. The chatbot will feature adult and nerdy animations, stunning 3D visuals, and seamless local integration with Phoenix Hydra's event routing system. The interface will be built using React, Tailwind CSS, Spline 3D models, and advanced animation libraries to create a professional, engaging user experience.
