# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agent Hooks Refactoring feature aims to migrate the existing hooks from `src/agent_hooks/hooks` to the new architecture in `.kiro/engine`. This refactoring will standardize the hook implementation, improve event routing, and enhance the overall reliability and maintainability of the agent hooks system. The new architecture provides a more robust framework for event handling, filtering, and correlation, allowing for more sophisticated automation scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate existing hooks to the new architecture, so that they can benefit from the improved event routing and filtering capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve its original functionality
2. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL use the new `AgentHook` base class from `.kiro/engine/core/models.py`
3. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL implement proper event filtering using `EventFilterGroup`
4. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL handle state management internally where needed
5. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL include appropriate error handling and logging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure backward compatibility during the migration, so that existing functionality is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL maintain the same event triggering conditions
2. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve any configuration options
3. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing use cases continue to work
4. IF a hook has dependencies on other components THEN the system SHALL maintain those relationships

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper testing for migrated hooks, so that I can ensure they function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for its functionality
2. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL have integration tests with the event router
3. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL verify all acceptance criteria through tests
4. IF a hook has complex logic THEN the system SHALL include tests for edge cases and error conditions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the event routing system to handle the migrated hooks, so that events are properly dispatched.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is triggered THEN the system SHALL route it to all matching hooks
2. WHEN multiple hooks match an event THEN the system SHALL execute them in priority order
3. WHEN a hook execution fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other hooks
4. WHEN events are correlated THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate higher-level events

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to document the migrated hooks and their configuration, so that other developers can understand and use them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive docstrings
2. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL document its configuration options
3. WHEN a hook is migrated THEN the system SHALL provide usage examples
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL update any relevant developer documentation
