# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive review of the Phoenix Hydra system and creating a complete TODO checklist to evaluate the current development status at 100%. Phoenix Hydra is a self-hosted multimedia and AI automation stack built on a digital cellular architecture, currently at 95% completion with active monetization strategy targeting â‚¬400k+ revenue in 2025.

The system review will assess all components including core infrastructure, monetization layers, automation systems, documentation, and operational readiness to provide a definitive evaluation of the current state and identify remaining tasks for 100% completion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want a comprehensive system review of Phoenix Hydra, so that I can understand the complete current state of all components and subsystems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system review is initiated THEN the system SHALL analyze all core infrastructure components including NCA Toolkit, n8n workflows, Podman stack, Windmill GitOps, PostgreSQL database, and Minio S3 storage
2. WHEN evaluating infrastructure THEN the system SHALL assess container orchestration, health monitoring, auto-restart capabilities, and systemd integration status
3. WHEN reviewing monetization components THEN the system SHALL evaluate affiliate programs, revenue tracking, grant applications, marketplace preparations, and enterprise API configurations
4. WHEN analyzing automation systems THEN the system SHALL review VS Code integration, deployment scripts, Kiro agent hooks, and CI/CD pipeline readiness
5. WHEN examining documentation THEN the system SHALL verify technical architecture docs, monetization strategy, implementation roadmap, and deployment guides are complete and current

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want a detailed TODO checklist with completion status, so that I can track progress toward 100% system completion and identify remaining work items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the TODO checklist THEN the system SHALL create hierarchical task categories for Infrastructure, Monetization, Automation, Documentation, Testing, and Security
2. WHEN evaluating each task THEN the system SHALL provide completion percentage, current status (Complete/In Progress/Not Started), and priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. WHEN assessing infrastructure tasks THEN the system SHALL include container deployment, service health checks, database configuration, storage setup, and networking configuration
4. WHEN reviewing monetization tasks THEN the system SHALL include affiliate program setup, revenue tracking implementation, grant application preparation, marketplace listing readiness, and enterprise feature configuration
5. WHEN analyzing automation tasks THEN the system SHALL include VS Code task configuration, deployment script functionality, agent hook implementation, and CI/CD pipeline setup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to understand the gap between current 95% completion and 100% target, so that I can plan final implementation phases and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying completion gaps THEN the system SHALL list specific missing components, incomplete implementations, and pending configurations
2. WHEN analyzing remaining work THEN the system SHALL categorize tasks by estimated effort (hours/days), technical complexity (Low/Medium/High), and business impact (Critical/Important/Nice-to-have)
3. WHEN evaluating observability stack THEN the system SHALL assess Prometheus/Grafana deployment status, log aggregation setup, and alerting configuration
4. WHEN reviewing security hardening THEN the system SHALL evaluate SELinux policies, secret management, network policies, and compliance requirements
5. WHEN assessing production readiness THEN the system SHALL verify deployment automation, monitoring coverage, backup procedures, and disaster recovery capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to understand revenue stream readiness and monetization infrastructure status, so that I can make informed decisions about market launch and funding applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating revenue streams THEN the system SHALL assess DigitalOcean affiliate status, CustomGPT integration, AWS Marketplace readiness, Hugging Face configuration, and grant application status
2. WHEN analyzing monetization infrastructure THEN the system SHALL verify revenue tracking automation, metrics collection, reporting capabilities, and business intelligence features
3. WHEN reviewing grant applications THEN the system SHALL evaluate NEOTEC generator functionality, ENISA documentation readiness, and EIC Accelerator preparation status
4. WHEN assessing marketplace presence THEN the system SHALL verify AWS deployment scripts, Cloudflare Workers configuration, and enterprise API documentation
5. WHEN evaluating business metrics THEN the system SHALL review KPI tracking, success metrics definition, and performance monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify operational readiness and production deployment capabilities, so that I can ensure the system can be reliably deployed and maintained in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating deployment readiness THEN the system SHALL verify automated deployment scripts for Windows PowerShell and Linux bash environments
2. WHEN assessing service orchestration THEN the system SHALL confirm Podman compose configuration, systemd service definitions, and container health checks
3. WHEN reviewing monitoring capabilities THEN the system SHALL evaluate health endpoint functionality, service status tracking, and automated alerting
4. WHEN analyzing maintenance procedures THEN the system SHALL verify backup strategies, update procedures, and disaster recovery plans
5. WHEN evaluating scalability THEN the system SHALL assess resource requirements, performance benchmarks, and scaling procedures for increased load

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the current state of testing infrastructure and code quality measures, so that I can ensure the system meets quality standards for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating testing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL assess unit test coverage, integration test implementation, and end-to-end test scenarios
2. WHEN reviewing code quality THEN the system SHALL verify linting configuration, formatting standards, and static analysis tools
3. WHEN analyzing test automation THEN the system SHALL evaluate pytest configuration, test discovery, and continuous testing integration
4. WHEN assessing quality gates THEN the system SHALL verify pre-commit hooks, code review processes, and automated quality checks
5. WHEN evaluating performance testing THEN the system SHALL assess load testing capabilities, performance benchmarks, and resource utilization monitoring
