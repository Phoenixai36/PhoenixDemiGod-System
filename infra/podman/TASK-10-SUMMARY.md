# Task 10: Update Deployment Script for Podman - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the deployment script (`deploy.sh` and `deploy.ps1`) for Podman with enhanced user namespace mapping, volume cleanup and management scripts, and network isolation with security boundaries.

## Requirements Addressed

### Requirement 3.3: Volume Management
- ✅ Integrated volume setup and cleanup scripts into deployment workflow
- ✅ Added `--setup-volumes` and `--cleanup-volumes` options
- ✅ Proper volume permission handling for rootless execution
- ✅ Created PowerShell equivalents for Windows support

### Requirement 5.3: Network Configuration  
- ✅ Implemented network isolation and security boundaries
- ✅ Configured firewall rules for exposed ports (8000, 3000, 8080, 5000)
- ✅ Network namespace verification and cleanup
- ✅ DNS resolution and connectivity checks

### Requirement 6.2: User Namespace Mapping
- ✅ Enhanced rootless environment setup with user namespace mapping
- ✅ Created containers.conf with security optimizations
- ✅ Proper subuid/subgid configuration guidance
- ✅ Container user verification in deployment checks

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. Enhanced User Namespace Mapping
```bash
# Configure user namespace mapping for better security
setup_rootless() {
    # Check subuid/subgid configuration
    # Create containers.conf with security settings
    # Setup volumes with proper permissions
}
```

### 2. Network Isolation and Security Boundaries
```bash
configure_network_security() {
    # Clean network setup
    # Firewall configuration for ports 8000, 3000, 8080, 5000
    # Network namespace verification
    # Security boundary enforcement
}
```

### 3. Volume Management Integration
```bash
manage_volumes() {
    # Volume setup integration
    # Volume cleanup integration
    # Proper permission handling
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Verification
```bash
verify_deployment() {
    # Network isolation checks
    # User namespace mapping verification
    # Security boundary validation
    # Volume permission verification
    # Service health checks with security context
}
```

## New Command Line Options

### Bash Script (`deploy.sh`)
- `--setup-volumes`: Setup volumes only (don't deploy services)
- `--cleanup-volumes`: Cleanup volumes only (don't deploy services)
- Enhanced `--help` with security information

### PowerShell Script (`deploy.ps1`)
- `-SetupVolumes`: Setup volumes only (don't deploy services)
- `-CleanupVolumes`: Cleanup volumes only (don't deploy services)
- Enhanced `-Help` with security information

## Security Features Implemented

### Network Security
- Firewall rules for exposed ports (8000, 3000, 8080, 5000)
- Network isolation verification
- Internal service protection (PostgreSQL on 5432)
- DNS resolution security

### Container Security
- User namespace mapping configuration
- No-new-privileges enforcement
- Rootless execution verification
- Security capability restrictions

### Volume Security
- Proper permission setting (700 for db_data, 755 for nginx_config)
- User ownership verification
- Secure volume mounting with :Z labels

## Files Created/Modified

### Enhanced Files
- `deploy.sh` - Enhanced with user namespace mapping, network security, volume management
- `deploy.ps1` - Enhanced PowerShell version with same features

### New Files
- `infra/podman/setup-volumes.ps1` - PowerShell volume setup script
- `infra/podman/cleanup-volumes.ps1` - PowerShell volume cleanup script

## Testing Results

### Script Functionality
- ✅ Help functionality works correctly
- ✅ Syntax validation passes
- ✅ Compose file detection works
- ✅ Volume management options functional
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (Bash/PowerShell)

### Security Verification
- ✅ Network isolation configuration
- ✅ User namespace mapping setup
- ✅ Volume permission verification
- ✅ Firewall rule configuration
- ✅ Service health checks with security context

## Usage Examples

### Basic Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Volume Management Only
```bash
./deploy.sh --setup-volumes
./deploy.sh --cleanup-volumes
```

### Skip Checks (Advanced)
```bash
./deploy.sh --skip-checks --no-verify
```

### PowerShell Equivalent
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1
.\deploy.ps1 -SetupVolumes
.\deploy.ps1 -CleanupVolumes
```

## Security Boundaries Implemented

### Exposed Ports (External Access)
- 8000: gap-detector (with health checks)
- 3000: windmill (with API version checks)
- 8080: nginx (with connectivity checks)
- 5000: analysis-engine (with health checks)

### Internal Services (Network Isolated)
- 5432: PostgreSQL (database access only within phoenix-net)
- recurrent-processor (internal processing only)
- rubik-agent (internal agent communication only)

### Network Isolation
- All services run in isolated `phoenix-net` network
- Proper subnet configuration (172.20.0.0/16)
- DNS resolution between services
- External access only through defined ports

## Compliance with Requirements

### ✅ Requirement 3.3 (Volume Management)
- Volume cleanup and management scripts integrated
- Proper permission handling for rootless execution
- Cross-platform support (Bash/PowerShell)

### ✅ Requirement 5.3 (Network Configuration)
