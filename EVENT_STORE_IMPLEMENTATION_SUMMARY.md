# Event Store Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 8, 2025  
**Task:** Task 2 - Implement Event Store component  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Task 2.1: Create in-memory event store implementation
- **EventStoreBase** abstract interface with complete contract
- **InMemoryEventStore** thread-safe implementation
- Chronological event ordering with automatic sorting
- Fast ID-based lookups with dual storage (list + dict)
- Complete CRUD operations (store, retrieve, count, clear)

### ✅ Task 2.2: Add event filtering and querying
- **Basic Filtering**: By type, source, correlation_id, causation_id
- **Nested Filtering**: Payload and metadata with dot notation
- **Time-based Filtering**: Start/end time with datetime support
- **Pagination**: Limit and offset support
- **Pattern Matching**: Wildcard support for types and sources
- **Text Search**: Full-text search across payload and metadata
- **Aggregation**: Group events by any field
- **Timeline Queries**: Correlation and causation chain reconstruction

### ✅ Task 2.3: Implement retention policy and cleanup
- **RetentionPolicy** class with multiple strategies
- **Age-based Retention**: Configurable maximum age
- **Count-based Retention**: Configurable maximum count
- **Event-type Specific Policies**: Different rules per event type
- **Correlation Preservation**: Keep complete correlation chains
- **Priority-based Cleanup**: Preserve high-priority events
- **Retention Statistics**: Analysis of what would be cleaned up

## Key Features Implemented

### 🔧 Core Event Store Operations
```python
# Basic operations
store.store(event)                          # Store event
event = store.get_event_by_id(event_id)     # Retrieve by ID
events = store.get_events()                 # Get all events
count = store.get_event_count()             # Count events
store.clear()                               # Clear all events
```

### 🔍 Advanced Querying
```python
# Filtering
events = store.get_events(
    filter_criteria={"type": "user.login", "payload.success": True},
    start_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=1),
    limit=100
)

# Pattern matching
events = store.get_events_by_type_pattern("user.*")
events = store.get_events_by_source_pattern("service.*")

# Text search
events = store.search_events("error", ["payload", "metadata"])

# Correlation tracking
timeline = store.get_event_timeline(correlation_id)
correlated = store.get_events_by_correlation_id(correlation_id)

# Aggregation
grouped = store.aggregate_events("type", filter_criteria={"source": "api"})
```

### 🧹 Retention Management
```python
# Create retention policies
age_policy = RetentionPolicy.create_age_based_policy(24.0)  # 24 hours
count_policy = RetentionPolicy.create_count_based_policy(1000)  # 1000 events
combined = RetentionPolicy.create_combined_policy(24.0, 1000, preserve_correlations=True)

# Event-type specific policies
policy = RetentionPolicy()
policy.add_event_type_policy("error.*", RetentionPolicy.create_age_based_policy(168.0))  # 1 week for errors
policy.add_event_type_policy("debug.*", RetentionPolicy.create_age_based_policy(1.0))    # 1 hour for debug

# Cleanup and analysis
stats = store.get_retention_stats(policy)  # Analyze before cleanup
removed = store.cleanup_expired_events(policy)  # Perform cleanup
```

### 📊 Statistics and Monitoring
```python
# Store statistics
stats = store.get_stats()
# Returns: total_events, oldest_event, newest_event, event_types, sources

# Retention analysis
retention_stats = store.get_retention_stats(policy)
# Returns: events_to_expire, events_to_keep, count_based_expiration, etc.
```

## Thread Safety & Performance

### 🔒 Thread Safety
- **RLock** used for all operations to prevent deadlocks
- **Atomic operations** for all read/write operations
- **Safe concurrent access** from multiple threads
- **Consistent state** maintained during cleanup operations

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- **Dual storage strategy**: List for chronological order + Dict for fast ID lookup
- **Lazy sorting**: Events sorted only when needed
- **Efficient filtering**: Early termination and optimized loops
- **Memory efficient**: Minimal object copying
- **Batch operations**: Efficient cleanup and aggregation
