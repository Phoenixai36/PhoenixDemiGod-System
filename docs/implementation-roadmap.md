This document outlines the technical implementation phases for the Phoenix Hydra monetization strategy.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Automation (Weeks 1-2)

- **Objective:** Configure the basic monetization layers and agent context.
- **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Integrate Affiliate Badges:** Add DigitalOcean and CustomGPT referral badges to the main `README.md` and other relevant documentation.
    2.  **Configure VS Code Agent:** Set up `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json` to provide context and automated tasks for agents like Cline and Continue.dev.
    3.  **Create Hugging Face Paid Space:** Establish a "Paid Space" on Hugging Face to host a monetized Phoenix model.
    4.  **Initiate NEOTEC Application:** Begin the grant application process for NEOTEC, leveraging automated script generators. (Critical Deadline: 12 Jun 2025).

## Phase 2: Marketplace Preparation (Weeks 3-4)

- **Objective:** Prepare the necessary assets and configurations for enterprise marketplace listings.
- **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **AWS ISV Accelerate Application:** Submit the application to the AWS ISV Accelerate program to facilitate marketplace entry.
    2.  **Docker Hub Pro Setup:** Configure a Docker Hub Pro account to host and distribute the official Phoenix container images.
    3.  **Cloudflare Workers Deployment:** Develop and deploy scripts on Cloudflare Workers for edge-based functionalities and integrations.
    4.  **Define Enterprise Endpoints:** Specify and document the enterprise-tier endpoints for the NCA Toolkit.

## Phase 3: Enterprise Scaling (Months 2-3)

- **Objective:** Launch on enterprise marketplaces and scale revenue-generating activities.
- **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **Complete AWS Marketplace Listing:** Finalize and publish the Phoenix Hydra offering on the AWS Marketplace.
    2.  **Launch Pay-Per-Crawl Pilot:** Initiate a pilot program with a key client for a usage-based pricing model.
    3.  **Secure ENISA FEPYME Loan:** Apply for the â‚¬300k, 0% interest loan from ENISA to fund scaling operations.
    4.  **Automate Revenue Metrics:** Implement and automate the revenue tracking scripts, feeding data into the observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana).

## Phase 4: Full-Scale Automation & Observability (Months 3-6)

- **Objective:** Achieve a fully automated, observable, and resilient system.
- **Key Tasks:**
    1.  **CI/CD GitOps Pipeline:** Implement a full GitOps workflow using GitHub Actions for building and pushing Podman images and updating Quadlet definitions.
    2.  **Establish Staging Environment:** Create a parallel `phoenix-staging` pod for testing and demos.
    3.  **Harden Security:** Enforce SELinux policies and configure network rules (nftables) for the rootless containers.
    4.  **Develop Grant Generators:** Fully develop the `neotec_generator.ts` and `eic_accelerator.py` scripts within Windmill for automated grant proposal generation.
