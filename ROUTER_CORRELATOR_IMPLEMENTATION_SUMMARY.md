## Key Features Implemented

### 🔗 Event Correlation System
```python
# Automatic correlation
correlator = EventCorrelator(router, store, auto_correlate=True)

# Manual correlation
correlation_id = correlator.correlate(event)
chain = correlator.get_correlation_chain(correlation_id)

# Find related events
related = correlator.find_related_events(event_id, include_causation=True)

# Create correlation groups
group_id = correlator.create_correlation_group(event_ids, metadata)

# Statistics and cleanup
stats = correlator.get_correlation_statistics()
removed = correlator.cleanup_old_correlations(max_age_hours=24.0)
```

### 🚀 Enhanced Event Router
```python
# Advanced router configuration
router = EventRouter(
    pattern_matcher=WildcardPatternMatcher(),
    enable_delivery_confirmation=True,
    max_concurrent_deliveries=10
)

# Multiple delivery modes
router.publish(event, DeliveryMode.SYNC)    # Synchronous
router.publish(event, DeliveryMode.ASYNC)   # Asynchronous  
router.publish(event, DeliveryMode.QUEUED)  # Queued

# Retry mechanism
success = router.publish_with_retry(
    event, 
    max_retries=3, 
    retry_delay=1.0
)

# Error handling
def error_handler(event, subscription, exception):
    print(f"Delivery failed: {exception}")

router.add_error_handler(error_handler)

# Subscription management
router.pause_subscription(subscription_id)
router.resume_subscription(subscription_id)
router.cleanup_expired_subscriptions()
```

### 📊 Comprehensive Statistics
```python
# Router statistics
router_stats = router.get_stats()
# Returns: events_published, successful_deliveries, failed_deliveries,
#          async_deliveries, sync_deliveries, queued_deliveries

# Correlation statistics  
corr_stats = correlator.get_correlation_statistics()
# Returns: events_processed, correlations_created, active_correlation_chains,
#          average_chain_size, correlation_coverage
```
